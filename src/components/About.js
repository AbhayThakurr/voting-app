        If system is integrated with blockchain- a special property called
        immutability protects system. Consider SQL, PHP, or any other
        traditional database systems. You can insert, update, or delete votes.
        But in a blockchain you can just insert data but cannot update or
        delete. Hence when you insert something, it stays there forever and no
        one can manipulate it- Thus name immutable ledger.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        But Building a blockchain system is not enough. It should be
        decentralized i.e if one server goes down or something happens on a
        particular node, other nodes can function normally and do not have to
        wait for victim nodeâ€™s recovery.
